Good. Then we do this **cleanly, conservatively, and in a way that protects you from yourself**.

Below is a **rewritten portfolio as a Phase-1 / Phase-2 roadmap**, explicitly designed to:

* survive Swiss buyer scrutiny
* fit an 80% employment reality
* reinforce the **Independent AI Assurance** archetype
* avoid accidental slide back into “builder / freelancer” mode

This is **ready-to-paste** as a standalone document (e.g.
`01_strategy/portfolio_roadmap.md`).

# Portfolio Roadmap

## Independent AI Assurance & Governance Practice

---

## Guiding principle

> **Phase-1 optimizes for credibility, bounded risk, and income stability.**
> **Phase-2 optimizes for leverage, retention, and optionality — only after proof.**

Nothing in Phase-2 is required for Phase-1 success.
Phase-2 is earned, not assumed.

---

# Phase-1: Independent AI Assurance (Core Business)

**Objective:**
Establish yourself as a trusted, independent **AI risk & assurance specialist** for Swiss organizations.

**Time horizon:**
0–12 months

**Operating constraints:**

* Solo operator
* 80% employed
* Fridays + limited async time
* Zero legal ambiguity
* No production responsibility

---

## Phase-1 Identity

**Archetype:**

> *Independent AI Risk & Readiness Auditor*

**What you do**

* Assess
* Stress-test
* Classify risk
* Issue defensible recommendations

**What you explicitly do not do**

* Build systems
* Tune models
* Own production outcomes
* Provide legal sign-off

---

## Phase-1 Core Services (Non-Negotiable)

These services form a **tight, mutually reinforcing core**.
Each is:

* time-boxed
* audit-shaped
* authority-reinforcing

---

### 1️⃣ Risk & Safety Workshop (Primary Wedge)

**Type:**
Structured assurance workshop

**Purpose:**
Define what “safe”, “acceptable”, and “unacceptable” means *before* deployment.

**Why it exists**

* Low friction entry
* SME-driven
* Politically safe inside organizations
* Naturally disqualifies unserious buyers

**Typical buyer**

* Compliance
* Legal
* Data Office
* CISO

**Outcome**

* Documented risk map
* Failure mode inventory
* Explicit refusal conditions

**Status:**
✅ Mandatory entry point for deeper work

---

### 2️⃣ Vendor Safety Audit

**Type:**
Independent vendor due-diligence assessment

**Purpose:**
Answer: *“Is this AI vendor safe to use in our context?”*

**Why it exists**

* Immediate, recurring pain
* Familiar audit pattern
* Clear Pass / Conditional / Fail outcome

**Scope**

* Data usage & training rights
* Residency & control
* Architectural red flags

**Outcome**

* Short, defensible audit memo
* Clear recommendation

**Status:**
✅ Phase-1 cornerstone

---

### 3️⃣ Adversarial Behavior Assessment

*(formerly “Red Team Assessment”)*

**Type:**
Black-box behavioral stress test

**Purpose:**
Surface failure modes *before* public or internal exposure.

**Why it exists**

* Perfect fit with security mindset
* Highly differentiated
* Appeals to risk-aware buyers

**Critical framing**

* Behavioral, not pentesting
* No exploit claims
* No remediation ownership

**Outcome**

* Classified failure report
* Severity assessment
* Go / No-Go signal

**Status:**
⚠️ Phase-1 advanced offering (rename strictly enforced)

---

### 4️⃣ EU AI Act Gap Analysis (Scoped)

**Type:**
Regulatory readiness assessment (non-certifying)

**Purpose:**
Help organizations understand *exposure*, not claim compliance.

**Why it exists**

* Regulatory pressure is real
* PhD credibility matters
* Strong Swiss/EU fit

**Hard boundaries**

* Self-assessment support only
* No compliance guarantees
* No certification language

**Outcome**

* Gap matrix
* Risk classification
* Next-step options

**Status:**
⚠️ Phase-1 allowed, tightly scoped

---

## Phase-1 Conditional Add-Ons (Use Sparingly)

These are **not front-page offerings**.
They are used tactically, not marketed aggressively.

---

### Swiss AI Policy Pack

**Status:** ⚠️ Bundled only

* Never sold as “legal policy”
* Positioned as *internal working draft*
* Used to accelerate workshops or audits

---

### Governance Retainer

**Status:** ⚠️ Post-audit only

* Quarterly check-ins
* No operational responsibility
* “Second brain”, not execution

---

## Phase-1 Explicit Exclusions

These are **deliberately excluded** to protect authority and sanity:

❌ Golden Set Generation
❌ Grant Ethics Writing
❌ Candidate Vetting
❌ Drift Monitoring / SaaS
❌ Model tuning or system building

---

# Phase-2: Controlled Leverage & Retention (Optional)

**Objective:**
Increase leverage *without* compromising independence or risk posture.

**Time horizon:**
12–36 months
**Trigger:**
Only after multiple successful Phase-1 engagements.

---

## Phase-2 Identity Shift (Subtle, Not Radical)

From:

> Independent Auditor

To:

> Independent Auditor with **repeatable assurance infrastructure**

Still not:

* a vendor
* a platform company
* a SaaS startup

---

## Phase-2 Eligible Extensions

Only consider these **after** Phase-1 is stable.

---

### Governance Retainer (Formalized)

* Limited client set
* Explicit SLA boundaries
* Audit refresh cycles

Purpose:

* Predictable income
* Relationship continuity
* Authority reinforcement

---

### Drift Monitoring (Revisited Carefully)

Only if:

* framed as *signal*, not guarantee
* opt-in
* no implied liability

Likely positioning:

> “Early warning indicator, not continuous assurance”

---

### Tooling Productization (Evaluizer)

**Very long-term optionality**

* Only if:

  * clients explicitly ask
  * you can productize without support hell
* Otherwise remains:

  * internal tool
  * client handover artifact

---

# Phase-2 Explicit Non-Goals

Even in Phase-2, you do **not** become:

❌ An implementation partner
❌ A managed service provider
❌ A compliance certifier
❌ A VC-scale SaaS founder

Those are different businesses.

---

# Final Strategic Truth

Phase-1 success is defined by:

* credibility
* clarity
* repeatable audits
* sustainable income

Phase-2 is optional.

> **If Phase-1 alone pays you well and keeps your life sane,
> you have already won.**

---

## Mentor’s final note

This roadmap does one crucial thing:

It **protects you from over-ambition**.

Most smart people fail not because they aim too low,
but because they try to monetize *everything they can do*.

You don’t need more ideas.
You need **discipline and patience**.

If you want, next we can:

* rewrite your public positioning in Phase-1 language only, or
* design the exact sales motion for the Risk & Safety Workshop

Say the word.
