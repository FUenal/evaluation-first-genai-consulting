# 15-Minute Intro Call

## Independent AI Risk & Readiness Audit

---

## Purpose of the call (internal)

* Qualify whether this is an **assurance problem**, not an implementation request
* Confirm decision ownership and accountability
* Decide whether a **Risk & Safety Workshop** makes sense
* Disqualify politely but firmly if it does not

This call is **not**:

* solution design
* technical troubleshooting
* vendor comparison
* brainstorming

---

## Structure (15 minutes total)

```
0–2 min   Context & role framing
2–6 min   Decision & risk framing
6–10 min  Current state & concern
10–13 min Fit check & boundaries
13–15 min Clear next step or stop
```

---

## 0–2 min — Role framing (set the tone)

> “Before we start, a quick clarification of my role so we don’t waste each other’s time.
> I work as an **independent assessor**. I don’t build or implement AI systems.
> My job is to assess whether a system is safe, defensible, and appropriate to deploy in your context.”

> “If you’re looking for someone to build or tune a system, I’m probably not the right person.
> If you’re looking for an independent risk and readiness assessment, then this is exactly what I do.”

*(Pause. Let them react.)*

---

## 2–6 min — Decision & accountability framing

Ask **one** of the following (pick what fits):

* “What decision are you ultimately trying to make about this AI system?”
* “Who will be accountable if this system produces an unacceptable outcome?”
* “What would ‘getting this wrong’ look like for your organization?”

**Listen carefully.**
If there is no clear decision or owner, note it mentally.

---

## 6–10 min — Current state & concern

> “What prompted this conversation now?”

Follow-ups (only if needed):

* “Is there already a prototype or vendor involved?”
* “What makes you uneasy about the current situation?”
* “Has Legal, Compliance, or Security raised concerns?”

**Red flags (disqualifiers):**

* “We just want to experiment”
* “We’ll worry about risk later”
* “We want a rubber stamp”

Do not argue. Just note.

---

## 10–13 min — Fit check & boundaries

> “For my work to be useful, two things need to be true.”

> “First, there must be **someone who owns the decision** — not just the technology.”
> “Second, we need **limited access to Subject Matter Experts** to define what acceptable behavior actually means.”

> “Does that sound feasible in your organization?”

If **no** → politely disengage.
If **yes** → proceed.

---

## 13–15 min — Next step or stop

### If there is a fit

> “The usual next step is a **Risk & Safety Workshop**.
> It’s a time-boxed session where we define acceptance criteria, failure modes, and refusal rules.”

> “The output is not a system design, but clarity on whether further assessment makes sense — or whether the safest decision is to stop.”

> “Would it make sense to explore that?”

---

### If there is *not* a fit

> “Based on what you’ve described, I don’t think my role would add much value right now.
> That’s not a problem — it just means you may need implementation support before independent assessment becomes useful.”

This preserves authority.

## Notes for yourself (do not say out loud)

* You are **not selling AI**
* You are **screening for risk maturity**
* Silence is your ally
* If they push for solutions, repeat your role framing

---

## Success criteria for the call

The call is successful if:

* a workshop is booked, **or**
* you clearly decide not to proceed

A “no” is a win if it saves you a bad engagement.

### Mentor note (important)

This script now does three subtle but powerful things:

1. It **normalizes refusal** from the first minute
2. It reframes value as **decision safety**, not delivery
3. It filters out clients who would later cause scope creep

Once the proposal template is aligned, we can do **micro-edits** across all documents in one pass.

**Next document to rewrite (medium effort):**
👉 `proposal_template_1pager.md`

Say *continue* and we’ll do that next.
