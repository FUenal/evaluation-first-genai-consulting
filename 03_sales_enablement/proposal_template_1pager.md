Good. This is the **last heavy rewrite**. After this, we switch to **micro-edits only**.

Below is a **fully rewritten, audit-grade proposal template**, aligned with:

* the **Independent AI Assurance** archetype
* Swiss procurement and governance expectations
* the “Proceed · Iterate · Stop” decision logic
* fixed-scope, time-boxed reality
* your independence and conflict-of-interest constraints

Paste this as a complete replacement for

# Proposal

## Independent AI Risk & Readiness Audit

**Client:** [Organization Name]
**Prepared by:** Fatih Ünal
**Role:** Independent AI Assurance Specialist
**Date:** [Date]

---

## 1. Purpose of this engagement

The purpose of this engagement is to provide an **independent, evidence-based assessment** of whether a proposed or existing AI-assisted knowledge system is:

* safe to use in its intended context
* defensible from a governance and risk perspective
* appropriate to deploy given organizational accountability and regulatory exposure

This engagement is **not** intended to design, build, or optimize an AI system.
Its sole purpose is to support a **defensible decision**.

---

## 2. Scope of assessment

The audit will focus on the following areas:

### 2.1 Domain & risk framing

* clarification of the decision the system would support
* identification of accountability and decision ownership
* articulation of unacceptable outcomes

### 2.2 SME-defined acceptance criteria

* definition of what constitutes acceptable behavior
* identification of intolerable failure modes
* explicit refusal and abstention conditions

### 2.3 Failure taxonomy & behavioral risk

* classification of relevant failure types (e.g. hallucination, omission, overconfidence)
* assessment of severity and decision impact

### 2.4 Evaluation & evidence

* structured inspection of system behavior (where applicable)
* review of evaluation artifacts or test scenarios
* identification of irreducible risks

### 2.5 Governance & regulatory exposure

* high-level review of governance readiness
* identification of regulatory or policy gaps
* decision-relevant risk flags (non-certifying)

---

## 3. Explicit exclusions

To preserve independence and clarity of responsibility, this engagement **explicitly excludes**:

* system implementation or deployment
* model or prompt tuning
* production operation or monitoring
* legal certification or compliance sign-off

Any recommendations provided are **advisory**, not guarantees.

---

## 4. Method of work

The engagement is conducted as a **time-boxed audit** combining:

* limited synchronous sessions (workshop / interviews)
* asynchronous analysis and documentation
* structured use of evaluation and classification instruments

Delays in client data access or availability **do not extend** the engagement duration.

---

## 5. Deliverables

Depending on the agreed scope, deliverables may include:

* an audit memo summarizing findings and risk posture
* a documented risk map and failure taxonomy
* evidence excerpts supporting conclusions
* a clear, written recommendation for decision owners

All deliverables are designed to be:

* internally reusable
* suitable for governance discussions
* independent of specific vendors

---

## 6. Possible outcomes

The engagement will conclude with one of the following recommendations:

* **Proceed** — risks are bounded and acceptable
* **Iterate** — risks exist but may be reducible
* **Stop** — risks are unacceptable in the current context

A recommendation to **stop** is considered a **successful outcome** if it prevents foreseeable harm.

---

## 7. Independence & conflict-of-interest

Fatih Ünal acts solely as an **independent assessor**.

He does not:

* implement systems arising from this assessment
* accept compensation tied to deployment outcomes
* act as a vendor or solution provider

This independence is a core feature of the engagement.

---

## 8. Engagement parameters

* **Duration:** [e.g. 2–6 weeks, depending on scope]
* **Format:** Fixed scope, fixed duration
* **Availability:** Limited synchronous time, scheduled in advance
* **Fee:** CHF [amount] (excl. VAT), payable [terms]

---

## 9. Next step

If this proposal aligns with your expectations, the recommended next step is to:

1. confirm scope and decision ownership
2. schedule the initial Risk & Safety Workshop

No work will begin without explicit agreement on scope and boundaries.

---

### Mentor checkpoint (important)

This proposal now:

* reads like an **audit mandate**, not a consulting SOW
* makes independence legally and psychologically clear
* protects you from scope creep
* normalizes “Stop” as an outcome

At this point, **do not rewrite further** unless a real client forces a change.
