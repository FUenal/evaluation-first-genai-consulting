## “Why 95% of GenAI Systems Fail — and how to be in the 5%”

This is **not** a blog post.
It’s a conversation anchor.

You send it:

* before intro calls
* to skeptical stakeholders
* to decision-makers who are nervous but curious

### Headline

**Why 95% of GenAI Systems Fail in Practice**

*And what successful organizations do differently*

---

### The uncomfortable reality

Most GenAI systems fail not because the models are weak, but because organizations deploy them **without defining what success and failure actually mean**.

Typical symptoms:

* impressive demos that collapse in real use
* pilot fatigue and loss of trust
* hidden risks discovered too late
* inability to explain or defend system behavior

---

### The five root causes of failure

1. **No explicit success criteria**
   “It seems good” is not an evaluation strategy.

2. **No domain-grounded evaluation data**
   Systems are tested on generic prompts, not real decisions.

3. **No error taxonomy**
   All mistakes are treated as equal — until one causes damage.

4. **No refusal or uncertainty design**
   Systems answer questions they should not answer.

5. **No way to measure improvement over time**
   Changes are made blindly, without regression testing.

---

### What the 5% do differently

Successful GenAI systems are designed around **evaluation first**:

* domain experts define acceptable and unacceptable behavior
* risks are classified before systems are built
* failure modes are made explicit
* evaluation datasets exist before optimization
* systems are tested continuously as data and prompts change

In other words:
**They treat GenAI as a decision system, not a demo.**

---

### The key principle

> If a system cannot be evaluated in a way that reflects real-world risk, it should not be deployed.

---

### What this means in practice

Before building anything, organizations should be able to answer:

* What does a *bad* answer look like?
* When must the system refuse?
* Which errors are unacceptable?
* Who remains accountable?

If these questions cannot be answered, no amount of model tuning will help.

---

### Why this matters

Evaluation-first design:

* reduces deployment risk
* prevents reputational damage
* saves time and cost by avoiding false starts
* builds trust with users and stakeholders

It is slower upfront — and dramatically faster overall.

---

### Closing line (soft CTA)

If your organization is under pressure to “use GenAI”, but unsure how to do so responsibly, an evaluation-first assessment can clarify whether this is the right path — and under what conditions.

---

## Consultant’s closing assessment

You now have:

* a **distinctive core offer**
* a **credible evaluation methodology**
* a **tangible SME interaction**
* a **clear narrative explaining failure and success**
* a **tool (Evaluizer) that supports continuity without locking clients in**

This is not “AI consulting”.
This is **decision systems consulting with modern tools**.

---

## What I would do next (optional but powerful)

When you’re ready, the next logical artifacts are:

1. **A 15-minute intro call script** (what you say, what you don’t)
2. **A 1-page proposal template** using the workshop + assessment
3. **A short Evaluizer demo flow** (screenshots + explanation)

But pause here if you need — this is already a *solid, coherent product*.

If you want to continue, tell me which of the three you want next.
